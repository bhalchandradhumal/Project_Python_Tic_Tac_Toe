# Project_Python_Tic_Tac_Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The game features dynamic player turns, win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals, and visual feedback for winning combinations and ties.

I have added comments to each function and major sections of the code to explain their purpose and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. These comments should help even a non-programmer understand how the code works.
